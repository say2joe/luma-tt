<p>Thanks for your interest in joining the Luma Pictures dev team! This coding test will assess your comfort level with front-end web development. Although time is an important factor, it's more important that you write quality code. Feel free to improve aesthetics and usability as you see fit.</p>

<h4>Your Tasks</h4>
<p>You'll be working on making improvements to a simple task tracker. The tasks you'll need to complete are in the task list itself. Complete as much of the tasks as you can. Bonus points if you version your changes in a Git or Mercurial repository.</p>

<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>When you are finished, please zip your final project directory and submit it to <a href="mailto:chrisl@luma-pictures.com">chrisl@luma-pictures.com</a> for review. Please also indicate what tasks you weren't able to complete. If you weren't able to complete some tasks, please briefly describe what you would have done to tackle the problem.</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>Jasmine UI tests are in the <tt>public/js/spec</tt> directory. If you're more comfortable with another testing framework (such as QUnit), feel free to use that instead. If you need to add new test spec files, you'll also need to edit the <tt>js/test.js</tt> file, so that they're included. You can access the Jasmine test runner at <a href="/test.html" target="_blank">/test.html</a> on this server.</p>

<h4>Libraries</h4>
<p>We've included some standard libraries for convenience. If you'd like to add more, feel free, but try to keep the amount of libraries used to a minimum. Here's a list of the included library documentation:</p>
